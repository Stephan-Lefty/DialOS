# TODO

A running list of small open items and next steps that Stephan or Claude
notice during day-to-day work. Unlike
[Open questions](docs/offene-punkte.en.md) (fundamental, not-yet-decided
architecture questions), these are concrete, checkable tasks. Completed
items are marked with a checkmark, not deleted - so it stays traceable
what has already been done.

- [ ] **Deprioritized, no longer the next step** (see the two new items
  below): Run a real live-boot test with `DialOS-Live-0.5.0-clone.iso`
  (supersedes the old, now outdated live-boot-test item for the 11.08
  ISO): before running `dialos-install`, check via `gdbus` whether
  `dialosadmin`/`nutzer` came along with the correct autologin status
  (see docs/sicherheit-datenschutz.en.md, section "Automatic login");
  then run through `dialos-install` completely with the security stick -
  unplug the external SanDisk-Extreme drive first (otherwise it's
  selectable as the target disk!); verify the new stick partitioning
  (`DIALOS-KEY` 2 GiB + `DIALOS-DATA` ext4).
- [ ] **New next step:** run a complete `dialos-install` installation
  with the new home-partition design on real hardware (T490) (see
  docs/sicherheit-datenschutz.en.md, section "Encrypting nutzer's data +
  security stick", for the full design). Check: ~100 GiB unencrypted
  root partition boots normally; `dialos-nutzer-home` (LUKS2) gets set
  up correctly during office setup; `dialos-setup-nutzer.sh` aborts
  cleanly without the stick plugged in instead of creating `nutzer`'s
  home on root; after setup: unplug the stick + reboot → normal GDM
  login screen, `/home/nutzer` empty/unmounted; plug the stick back in +
  reboot → `/home/nutzer` mounted, autologin works. Also verify
  `DIALOS-KEY` (now ext4, no longer FAT32) and `DIALOS-DATA` (now
  exFAT, no longer ext4) on a 64 GB stick. **Partially done already
  (2026-08-14):** the plain stick partitioning was manually tested
  (not via `dialos-install` itself, but by hand with the same commands)
  against a real 59.8 GB USB stick - `DIALOS-KEY` (ext4, root:root 755,
  neither readable nor writable for regular users - stronger protection
  than planned) and `DIALOS-DATA` (exFAT, writable for the current user)
  were created correctly. **Still open:** mount and write-test
  `DIALOS-DATA` on a real Windows machine (only verified on Linux so
  far).
- [x] Fundamental decision made (see above, implemented 2026-08-14):
  whole-disk LUKS encryption is gone entirely, replaced by a dedicated
  `dialos-nutzer-home` partition + the `dialos-stick-gate` gate.
  `dialos-install`/`dialos-rekey`/`dialos-stick-gate.sh` rewritten
  accordingly, dead `dialos-keyscript` initramfs files removed.
- [ ] The Calamares location page often suggests a wrong location based
  on GeoIP during live boot (e.g. Rome instead of Berlin) - no
  documented vendor override found for `modules/locale.conf` (only
  branding is officially overridable). Remains a tool limitation for
  now; the person installing must manually check/correct the location
  while clicking through (uncritical under two-phase provisioning, since
  end customers never see the installer).
- [ ] The Piper voice's speaking rate should be individually adjustable
  by the user (currently hardwired via `GenericRateMultiply` in the
  Piper config, `0.85` chosen as Stephan's personal preference) - needs
  a real setting (e.g. GNOME accessibility settings or a dedicated voice
  command), not just a config value.
- [x] Vosk (0.3.45) + hassil (3.11.0) + German Vosk models (large/small)
  documented as a repeatable recipe - done 2026-08-14 (see
  docs/Debian-zu-DialOS.en.md, step 15). Confirmed along the way: the
  original live installation had actually disappeared again
  (`import vosk` failed on re-check) - an interim reinstall of the T490
  had wiped it, exactly the trap this item warned about.
  `dialos-vosk-test.py` is now in the repo under
  `iso-build/config/includes.chroot/usr/local/bin/`. Also found: the
  model folders on the T490 (`/usr/local/share/vosk-model-de-big` and
  `-small`) contain doubly-nested duplicate copies of the model files
  due to an unzip mistake during the original test run (wastes disk
  space, measured ~6.3 GB instead of ~3.2 GB for the large model) - the
  new docs avoid the mistake, but the existing duplicate data on the
  T490 itself hasn't been cleaned up yet.
- [x] Ran and verified
  `pip3 install --break-system-packages vosk==0.3.45 hassil==3.11.0` on
  the T490 (2026-08-14) - `import vosk`/`hassil` works, `vosk.Model()`
  successfully loads the small German model.
- [ ] Run a real end-to-end test of `dialos-vosk-test.py` (actually
  speak into it, judge recognition quality) - so far only installation +
  model loading verified technically, no real speech recognition test
  with an actual spoken recording has run yet.
- [ ] On the next `eggs produce` run, record the new ISO in
  `docs/iso-builds.en.md` (version, date, commit hash, SHA256, Nextcloud
  location) and upload the file to Nextcloud - the table is currently
  empty/can't be backfilled (see commit history from 2026-08-14).
- [ ] The Bluetooth audio fix in `dialos-start-ansage.py`
  (single-instance lock/`alte_instanz_beenden()`) hasn't been
  conclusively confirmed over a longer period yet - check
  `/tmp/dialos-bluetooth-debug.log` if the problem recurs.
- [ ] Delete the stale local second repo copy under `~/DialOS-repo`, or
  deliberately keep it as a backup (decision still open) - the
  `~/DialOS` symlink is now correctly set up (see "Done" below), but
  the second copy itself is still sitting there. Two independent copies
  side by side are error-prone - that's exactly how two never-pushed
  commits from 2026-08-13 were nearly lost on 2026-08-14.
- [ ] Clean up leftover `/home/eggs/*.iso` files from the last builds
  (owned by `root`; the `eggs produce` NOPASSWD rule only covers
  `eggs produce` itself, not `rm` - needs Stephan's manual `sudo rm`).

## Done (kept for traceability)

- [x] Live desktop icon for the installer (`.desktop` file with its own
  DialOS icon instead of "Install System"/egg icon on the live boot
  desktop) - done 2026-08-10 (branding via skel override).
- [x] Build a new ISO with all the fixes collected so far (boot screen,
  avatar script, Calamares branding, Piper TTS) - done 2026-08-10/11
  (the 11.08 ISO).
- [x] Set up the `~/DialOS → .../SanDisk-Extreme/DialOS/repo` symlink
  again - done 2026-08-14 via `scripts/dialos-claude-setup.sh`, which
  now also restores the `eggs produce` sudoers rule on every reinstall.
- [x] Anchor the AppIndicator packages for `dialos-tts-indicator.py`
  (`gnome-shell-extension-appindicator`, `gir1.2-ayatanaappindicator3-0.1`)
  in the package list - done 2026-08-14, also added
  `gnome-shell-extension-desktop-icons-ng` (DING) while at it: GNOME
  hasn't shown desktop icons out of the box for years, without this
  extension the office-setup scripts on `dialosadmin`'s desktop (see
  below) would have stayed invisible.
